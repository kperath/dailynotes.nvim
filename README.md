# dailynotes.nvim üìù

`dailynotes.nvim` allows you to create "daily notes" (notes of the form yyyy-mm-dd.md) and iterate between them.

**Supported file types:** markdown, vimwiki

## Demo

## Why?
Other notetaking apps like Obsidian and Vscode Foam have this feature and after switching over to vim for notetaking it was one of the features I missed.

## Usage
`:Daily` opens todays daily note

`:NextDaily` opens the next daily note
  - Won't create a new file for the next day if one does not exist
  - Won't go past todays date

`:PrevDaily` opens the previous daily note
  - Won't create a file if one does not exist

## Installation
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

Add `use 'kperath/dailynotes.nvim'` to your packer plugins file.
```lua
require "dailynotes".setup({
    path = '<path to your daily notes>/'
})
```

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```vim
Plug 'kperath/dailynotes.nvim'

lua << EOF
require "dailynotes".setup({
    path = '<path to your daily notes>/'
})
EOF
```

**Note:** Assuming you have a centralized place where you keep your daily notes, it's recommended to set the `path` or by default your notes will be created in whatever directory you open vim.

## Dev setup
1. clone the repository
2. make your changes
3. from the project root run `nvim --cmd "set rtp+=./"` to open vim with the plugin in the run time path
